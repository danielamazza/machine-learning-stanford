Two motivations are important for talking about recommender systems: **applications** and **identification of crucial features**.

1. Important application of ML systems
	* Many technology companies find recommender systems to be absolutely a killer application: think about Amazon, Ebay, iTunes Genius.
		* Try and recommend new content for you based on passed purchases
		* Substantial part of Amazon's revenue generation
	* Improvement in recommender system performance can bring in more income
	* Kind of a funny problem
		* In academic learning, recommender systems receives a small amount of attention
		* But in industry it's an absolutely crucial tool

2. Talk about the big ideas in machine learning
	* Not so much a technique, but an idea
	* As soon, features are really important
		* There's a big idea in machine learning that for some problems you can learn what a good set of features are
		* So not select those features but learn them
	* Recommender systems do this - try and identify the crucial and relevant features

**Example - predict movie ratings**

You are a company who sells movies.
You let users rate movies using a **0-5 star rating** (using also "0" makes math easier).
You have **5 movies** and **4 users**.
